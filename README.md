# Coding-Concepts-Visualized
An app that takes in a raw file URL and allows you to create photos that pop up over sections of that code to create more intuitive explanations of your code using pictures instead of messy comments!


Setup: 
With Node 8.0+ installed: 
`npm install`
`npm run build-dev`
